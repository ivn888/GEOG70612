##A

* `Arrays` are a component of **JavaScript**. They are effectively lists of values stored in a single variable.

* `AJAX` means **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, but really just refers to the use of **JavaScript**'s `XMLHttpRequest` object to asynchronously retrieve data or other resources from elsewhere on the web.

##B

##C

* `Callback Functions` are a component of **JavaScript**. They are **Functions** that are called automatically when the previous operation has completed.

* `class` is an attribute of **HTML Elements** that should contain a non-unique value in order to group them together. The `class` can then be used by **CSS** in order to refer to a particular set of **Elements in the HTML** using a **Class Selector** in CSS (`.`, *see **Selectors***).

* `Closing Tags` are a component of **HTML**. They mark the end of an **Element**. They always correspond the the **Opening Tag** but start with a `/` (*e.g.* `</p>`).

* `Comments` are used in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** in order to help you to keeop track of what your code is doing. Examples of comments in **JavaScript** are given [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_comments.asp).

* `Concatenate` refers to the joining of two **Strings** into one. This is often achieved using the **concatenate operator** `+`.

* `Conditional` is type of statement in **JavaScript**. It is some code that runs only if certain criteria are met. These criteria will be tested by an `if...else`, `switch` or `ternery` statement.

* `Console` is a tool inside your Web Browser that you can use to test and validate your **JavaScript** using the command `console.log();`.

* `CSS` is **Cascading Style Sheets**. This is the language in which the style (colours, fonts etc.) of the web page is written. Information about CSS can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp).

##D

* `Declarations` are a component of CSS. They comprise a **Property** and a **Property Value**, which describe the style that you want to set, and the setting that you want to use respectively (*e.g.* `color: red;`).

* `do...while` statements are a type of **Loop** statement in **JavaScript**.


##E

* `Events` are a way in which **JavaScript** can interact with **HTML**. They are *fired* when something happens (*e.g.* a user clicks on something) and used to trigger a **JavaScript** reaction. Information about **Events** can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp).

* `Elements` are components of **HTML**. They are the combination of an **Opening Tag**, a **Closing Tag**, and the **Content** in- between.

##F

* `Falsy` values are a component of **JavaScript**. They are those values that **JavaScript**  consider to be equal to `false` (`underfined`, `null`, `NaN`, `""` etc.). 

* `for` statements are a type of **Loop** statement in **JavaScript**.

* `Functions` are a component of **JavaScript**. They are a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. Information about **Functions** can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp).

##G

##H

* `Hex Codes` are a way of representing **RGB** colours on the web. **Hex** is short for **Hexadecimal**, which is the correct name for the representation used. Colours start with a `#` symbol, and are then followed by six characters: two for **Red**, two for **Green** and two for **Blue**. the intensity of each component is represented by the two values, which are on a scale of 1-15, with 1-9 represented by the numbers 1-9, and 10-15 represented by the letters A-F. You can learn more about Hex Colour Codes [here](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colors.asp).

* `HTML` is **HyperText Markup Language**. This is the language in which the content of the web page (text, images etc.) is written. Information about HTML can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).

* `HSL` is a colour model that stands for **Hue, Saturation and Lightness**. It is used to denote colour within the styler operations. These operations to define colour are common within graphic design and web design. Hue indicates the basic colour, saturation indicates the intensity of that colour, and lightness indicates the relative amount of white or black in the constituent colour.


##I

* `id` is an attribute of **HTML Elements** that should contain a unique value. The `id` can then be used by **CSS** and **JavaScript** in order to refer to a particular **Element in the HTML**. This is done by the use of an **ID Selector** in CSS (`#`, *see **Selectors***) or the `getElementById()` function in JavaScript.

* `if...else` statements are a type of **conditional** statement in **JavaScript**.

* `Index` refers to the position of an element within gan **array**. The index values range from `0` to `length-1`.

* `Iteration` means looping through each element in a single object (e.g. an **array**).

##J

* `JavaScript` is a programming language used to make websites interactive and dynamic. Information about **JavaScript** can be found [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp).

* `JSON` (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write, and it is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is also used across almost all programming languages (in spite of the name).

##K

##L

* `Loop` statements run a block of code multiple times until a criteria is met. The criteria is tested on each run of the loop by a `for`, `while` or `do...while` statement. Looping over a single object (e.g. an **array** is referred to as **iteration**).

##M

* `Map features` are a component of the **Styled Maps** feature in the Google Maps API. They are the geographic elements that can be targeted on the map. These include roads, parks, bodies of water, and more, as well as their labels.

* `Map Styles` are a component of the **Styled Maps** feature in the Google Maps API. They are composed of **selectors** and **stylers**, and define which **Map Features** should have what **Styles** applies to them.

##N

##O

* `Opening Tags` are a component of **HTML**. They mark the start of an **Element** (*e.g.* `<p>`).

* `Operators` are a component of **JavaScript**. Information about **Operators** is available [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp).

##P

* `Pop` refers to removing an element from the end of an **array**.

* `Push` refers to adding an extra element to the end of an **array**.

##Q

##R

* `RGB` is a colour model that stands for **Red, Green, Blue**. In web design, it is usually represented by **Hex Codes**.

##S

* `Selectors` are a component of CSS. They tell CSS which elements to apply their **Declarations** to. They can select elements by their type (*e.g.* `p`), class (*e.g.* `-class`), id (*e.g.* `#my-id`), attribute (*e.g.* `img[src]`), or state (*e.g.* `a:hover`).

* `Selectors` are also a component of the **Styled Maps** feature of the Google Maps JavaScript API. They define which **Map Features** (roads, parks, bodies of water etc.) should be targeted with particular **Styles**.

* `Shift` refers to removing an element from the start of an **array**.

* `Slice` refers to extracting (but not removing) elements from anywhere in an **array**.

* `Splice` refers to removing elements from anywhere in an **array**. 

* `Styled Maps` are a component of the Google Maps JavaScript API. They allow you to programatically re-style the Google Map, changing the visual display of such elements as roads, parks, and built-up areas.

* `Stylers` are a component of the **Styled Maps** feature of the Google Maps JavaScript API. They are colour and visibility properties that can be applied to map features. They define the display colour through a combination of hue, colour, and lightness/gamma values.

* `Switch` statements are a type of **conditional** statement in **JavaScript**. 


##T

* `Tags` are a component of **HTML**. They comprise **Opening Tags** and **Closing Tags**, and are used to enclose the **Content** in an **Element**. A full list is available [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp).

* `Ternery` statements are a type of **conditional** statement in **JavaScript**.

##U

* `Unshift` refers to adding an element to the start of an **array**.

##V

* `Variables` are a component of **JavaScript**. They are used to manipulate values. They are containers that you can store values in. Information about **Variables** is available [here](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp).

##W

* `while` statements are a type of **Loop** statement in **JavaScript**.
