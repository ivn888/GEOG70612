#Welcome to GEOG70612/40612: GIS and the Web

---
###This is the contents page for the first six GIS and the Web practicals.

Because this course is called GIS and the Web, the practical handouts are all web pages. This is good because it means that you can access them from anywhere, and look back to them at any time if you wish. They also contain a lot of information that was given in the lectures, just in case you need to go over it again.

Each of the 2-hour practical sessions will involve you working through one or more instructional web pages, building up your skills as you go. I will always be in the practical with you to lend support, but you can all work through it at your own speed, and take it away to complete if you find that it's too much to get done inside 2 hours. 

If you get stuck, you are strongly encouraged to use **[Google](https://www.google.co.uk)** to try and discover the answer for yourself. If that doesn't help, try the **[Programming Support Forum](https://online.manchester.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/launchLink.jsp?course_id=_39871_1&content_id=_4165466_1&mode=cpview)**. Similarly, if you figure out something cool, or solve a hard problem, post that in the forum too! It may be a real help to someone else on the course!

A [**Glossary**](./glossary.html) of terms is available to help you remember what's what!

## Week 1: GIS and the Web
### Practical 1: Introducing Google Maps
Practical one is all about learning to get to grips with a web page, and with **Google Maps** itself. You will be introduced to key web technologies such as **HTML** and **CSS**.

1. [Introduction to Google Maps](./practical1/index.html)
1. [Introduction to HTML](./practical1/html.html)
1. [Introduction to CSS](./practical1/css.html)

## Week 2: Projections and the Web
### Practical 2: Coding Google Maps
Practical two is where you dive into **JavaScript**, learn how to work with Events and understand exactly what makes a Google Map tick.

1. [Introduction to JavaScript](./practical2/index.html)
1. [Coordinates in Google Maps](./practical2/coordinates.html)

[*Hint!*](http://students.jonnyhuck.co.uk/maps/coords_gmap.html)

*Also, here is a link to the [Web Mercator Distortion Example](http://students.jonnyhuck.co.uk/maps/tissot.html) from the lecture.*

## Week 3: Cartography and the Web
### Practical 3: Styling Google Maps
Practical combines your skills in **CSS** and **JavaScript** as you re-style a Google Map, replacing the familiar corporate style with our own design.

1. [Styling Google Maps](./practical3/index.html)

*No hint needed this week, there are plenty of examples in the practical itself*

## Week 4: Openness and the Web
### Practical 4: Thematic Google Maps
Practical 4 takes you further into **JavaScript**, as you explore some of its more complex features, including **AJAX**, which shows you how to asynchronously interact with the server from your web page using **JavaScript**. You will use this to add some Open Data from the Police to your map.

1. [Arrays in JavaScript](./practical4/index.html)
1. [Controlling JavaScript](./practical4/control.html)
1. [External Data in Google Maps](./practical4/thematic.html)

[*Hint!*](http://students.jonnyhuck.co.uk/maps/thematic_gmap.html)

## Week 5: Social Media and the Web
### Practical 5: More Thematic Google Maps
In Practical 5 you will continue to use the data that you collected in Practical 4 in order to make more useful maps from your Police data. 

1. [More Thematic Mapping](./practical5/index.html)
1. [Heatmaps](./practical5/heat.html)

[*Hint 1!*](http://students.jonnyhuck.co.uk/maps/classified_gmap.html)
[*Hint 2!*](http://students.jonnyhuck.co.uk/maps/heat_gmap.html)

## Week 6: The Public and the Web
### Practical 6: Participatory Google Maps
Finally, Practical six is intended to help you to come up with an idea for your project. There is a short handout to work through to show you how to collect your data, followed by some free discussion time to help you get going with your assessment project.

1. [Collecting Data in Google Maps](./practical6/index.html)
1. ***Time for project advice.***
